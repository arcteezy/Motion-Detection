# Motion-Detection
Motion detection using PIR(Passive InfraRed) and Raspberry Pi.

## Requirements
1. PuTTY
2. VNC Viewer

## Setup
Make connections as in circuit(will be updated).</br>
Run the program in Raspberry Pi.</br>
Check for images in the SD card.

## Working
The PIR detects motion and produces an output which is converted to a pulse by the transistor working as a switch.</br>
This pulse triggers the NoIR Pi camera to take images and store them.
